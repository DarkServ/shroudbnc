shroudBNC 1.2
-------------

shroudBNC is a modular IRC proxy written in C++. It is capable of proxying
IRC connections for multiple users. Using TCL scripts it can be extended.

Installation
------------

First of all make sure that you have the following libraries installed:

- openssl (if you're going to use ssl-encrypted connections; README.ssl
           contains more details about how to use SSL)
- tcl     (if you're going to use the tcl module, version 8.4 or later, earlier
           versions have not been tested)

In order to compile and install sbnc you will have to use the 'configure'
script which is included in the distribution of sbnc:

./configure
make
make install

"make install" will install shroudBNC in a directory named "sbnc" in your home
directory.

Keep in mind that you need to change your current directory to ~/sbnc once you've
run "make install".

Once you've compiled sbnc you will need to edit shroudBNC's configuration
files:

You can do that by simply starting shroudBNC in the installation directory:

"shroud@hermes:~/sbnc$ ./sbnc
shroudBNC loader
Loading shroudBNC from ./lib-0/libsbnc.la
Thu Feb 16 09:33:36 2006 Log system initialized.
No valid configuration file has been found. A basic
configuration file can be created for you automatically. Please
answer the following questions:
1. Which port should the bouncer listen on (valid ports are in the range 1025 - 65535): 9000
2. What should the first user's name be? test
Please note that passwords will not be echoed while you type them.
3. Please enter a password for the first user:
4. Please confirm your password by typing it again:

shroudBNC 1.2 $Revision$ - an object-oriented IRC bouncer
Thu Feb 16 09:33:46 2006 Created main listener.
Thu Feb 16 09:33:46 2006 Starting main loop.
Daemonizing... DONE
shroud@hermes:~/sbnc$"

Basically you're finished here. Your bouncer is now configured and running.

You might want to edit the sbnc.tcl if you plan to use the TCL module. Load
any scripts you want. You will have to rehash the tcl module after every
change you make to sbnc.tcl or any other .tcl script which you have loaded:

/sbnc tcl rehash (while you're connected to the bouncer using an irc client)

Usage
-----

Just connect to the bouncer using your favorite IRC client. You will have to set
your username (i.e. e-mail address in most clients) to the accountname you've
chosen for your bnc.

Once you're connected you should type /sbnc help to get a list of available
commands.

shroudBNC supports oidentd in order to provide custom idents for each user. You
will need to enable ident-spoofing for the unix account you're using to run
shroudBNC if you want each user to have his/her own ident. Read oidentd's manual
or http://www.shroudbnc.info/board/index.php?t=msg&th=9 for more details.

TCL
---

The tcl module is automatically built and installed if the configure script
was able to find the appropriate tcl libraries and headers.

Updating shroudBNC
------------------

shroudBNC can be updated while it is running - without losing any active irc
or client connections. In order to update it you need to extract a clean copy
of shroudBNC somewhere.

After compiling it you can run the "make update" script which will
automatically update your currently running shroudBNC. (The script assumes
that the bouncer's directory is ~/sbnc/).

Security
--------

It is vital that you understand that any bouncer admin has access to:

a) the shell account where the bouncer is running
b) any user connections

Using the TCL module any admin can perform shell commands (using the exec
command) and send IRC commands for any user's connection. Thus you should
choose your admins wisely. Do not load arbitrary scripts and make sure you
understand any scripts you want to load.
