shroudBNC 1.0
-------------

shroudBNC is a modular framework for IRC clients. It supports TCL scripting and can be used as a bouncer.

Installation
------------

First of all make sure that you have the following libraries installed:

- libadns (for asynchronous support, mandatory) and libadns-dev (the header files)
- tcl (if you're going to use the tcl module, version 8.4 or later, earlier versions have not been tested)
- lua (if you want to use the lua scripting language, version 5.x or later)

In order to compile and install sbnc you will have to use the 'configure' script which is included in the distribution of sbnc:

./configure
make
make install

(Keep in mind that you need to change your current directory to ~/sbnc after executing "make install".)

Once you've compiled sbnc you will need to edit shroudBNC's configuration files:

sbnc.conf, users/username.conf and sbnc.tcl

The default sbnc.conf looks like this:

system.port=9000
system.users=example
system.md5=1

Simply replace 'example' with your desired username and set the bnc's port. If you want that sbnc listens on a specific ip address, you can add the following setting:

system.ip=your.ip.address.here

Rename the default user config file 'example.conf' (in the users directory) to match the username you've chosen. E.g. if your username is 'test' you should use 'test.conf' for the config file.

Edit the user config like you've edited the sbnc.conf. You will need the 'md5tool' utility to generate an md5 hash for your password:

dev@zero:~/sbnc$ ./md5tool password
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
dev@zero:~/sbnc$

You will have the opportunity to change your password again once the bouncer is online.

Also edit the sbnc.tcl if you plan to use the TCL module. Load any scripts you want.

You can start sbnc using './sbnc' or './sbnc -n' if you want to see the console output:

test@temple:~/sbnc$ ./sbnc
shroudBNC loader

test@temple:~/sbnc$

Usage
-----

Just connect to the bnc using your favorite IRC client. You will have to set your username (i.e. e-mail address in most clients) to the accountname you've chosen for your bnc.

Once you're connected you should type /sbnc help to get a list of available commands.

If you've compiled the TCL module you can load it using:

/sbnc insmod tickle/tickle.so

A list of loaded modules can be viewed using /sbnc lsmod. /sbnc rmmod <module-id> removes a module.

shroudBNC supports oidentd in order to provide custom idents for each user. You will need to enable ident-spoofing for the unix account you're using to run shroudBNC. Read oidentd's manual for more details.

TCL
---

Installing the TCL module might sometimes be a bit tricky. You should know this before you start to compile the TCL module:

-the path of your TCL libraries
-the path of the include files

The command for compiling the TCL module looks like this (You need to execute it in the sbnc-1.0/tickle directory):

g++ -I/include/directory -shared -Wl,-soname,ticklebnc -fPIC -o tickle.so *.cpp tickleProcs_wrap.c itoa.c -g /path/to/your/libtcl8.x.so

For example, if your include files are in /usr/include/tcl8.4 and your libtcl8.x.so can be found at /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so you can use this command to compile the TCL module:

g++ -I/usr/include/tcl8.4 -shared -Wl,-soname,ticklebnc -fPIC -o tickle.so *.cpp tickleProcs_wrap.c itoa.c -g /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so

Once you've compiled the TCL module there should be a file called "tickle.so". Copy it into the ~/sbnc directory and load it using this command (while connected to the bouncer): /sbnc insmod ./tickle.so

Updating shroudBNC
------------------

shroudBNC can be updated while it is running - without losing any active irc or client connections. In order to update it you need to extract a clean copy of shroudBNC somewhere.
After compiling it you can run the "make update" script which will automatically update your currently running shroudBNC. (The script assumes that the bouncer's directory is ~/sbnc/).

If you want to manually reload shroudBNC you need to copy the "sbnc.so" file which is created by the "make" command into your ~/sbnc directory. You must not use the filename of a currently loaded module as this would cause shroudBNC to segfault.

For example:

shroudBNC is running using the module file "sbnc.so". You could compile the updated version of shroudBNC somewhere and rename the new "sbnc.so" file to "sbnc-2.so". Then just copy it into ~/sbnc and use the command "/sbnc reload sbnc-2.so" to load the new module.

Please note that you might need to unload certain modules like tickle.so before upgrading shroudBNC as the old versions of the modules might not be compatible with the new shroudBNC version.

Security
--------

It is vital that you understand that any bouncer admin has access to:

a) the shell account where bouncer bnc is running
b) any user connections

Using the TCL module any admin can perform shell commands (using the exec command) and send IRC commands for any user's connection. Thus you should choose your admins wisely. Do not load arbitrary scripts and make sure you understand any scripts you want to load.

Giving shell access to someone you don't trust is potentially dangerous.
