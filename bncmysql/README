shroudBNC MySQL Config Module
-----------------------------

Using the MySQL Config Module you can store shroudBNC users and setting
in a MySQL database. You can even modify the tables directly (shroudBNC
will reload the settings from the database after a configurable interval; some
settings can not be modified though, simply because sbnc is not using them -
apart from when it's started, e.g. the userlist).

You can compile the module using:

	g++ -shared -g -o bncmysql.so bncmysql.cpp -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib -lmysqlclient

(You need to use the correct include/library directory for your mysql installation.)

Once you've successfully compiled your mysql module you need to copy it into your
shroudBNC directory:

	cp bncmysql.so ~/sbnc

You will also have to create a new bootstrap config (which will be used by the module
to "find" the real config source: your mysql database):

Filename: sbnc.conf
Content:

system.configmodule=./bncmysql.so
mysql.host=localhost
mysql.port=3306
mysql.user=your_mysql_user
mysql.password=your_mysql_pass
mysql.database=your_mysql_database

You may also specify the following options, however they are optional:

mysql.table - name of the mysql table (default: sbnc_config)
mysql.updateinterval - default update interval (sbnc re-fetches the config every once
			in a while; default: 300 seconds)

You need to create the database before launching shroudBNC. The table will be automatically
created for you on demand.

Once you've created the config file and database you can start shroudBNC:

test@temple:~/sbnc$ ./sbnc

That wasn't too difficult, was it? :)
